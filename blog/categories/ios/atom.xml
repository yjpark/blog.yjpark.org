    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>What is Movable Write</h2>

<p>Back in 2010, I already had some experiences on iOS development. Did wrote some very simple application to fetch information over HTTP-RPC to a trac instance, and wrote a very simple game with Cocos2D and Box2D. Did spend some time to catch up with the versions or iOS updates and read about the new APIs.</p>

<p>But my feeling was that by only spend small amount of time like it, I can never learn enough to have real experience on it, and I've been working on Web development for a few years. So I decided to work part-time in the company, and use the other half time to develop a real application, by real I mean with proper quality and released at app-store.</p>

<p>I just got a iPad1 as development device, and tried a few apps, I liked note plus a lot, it's very powerful, but a bit too powerful for my need, I want to write words most of the time, and I want to write largely, but view the written lines small.</p>

<p>So I decided to write a note taking app for myself, after 3 months, Movable Write was released at app store.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/movable-write/id416413981?mt=8">App store link</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wolfewithane.com/blog/2011/6/22/review-hand-notes-over-to-movable-write.html">A nice introduction from wolfewithane.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://iapp.com.tw/ex/topic_inside.php?id=2447">Another nice introduction from iapp.com.tw (in Chinese)</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>What is missed</h2>

<p>I did implement support for USB transfer for backup/restore, though didn't write document about this feature, the plan was to implement synchronization for it, Dropbox and/or iCloud, though didn't get time for it.</p>

<p>Another interesting possibility is Evernote integration, the code should be very easy to be runnable on OSX, also can be added as image or pdf.</p>

<p>A bigger change is adding bigger element into page, e.g. a photo then wrap the lines around it. I've done some experiments about bigger writing area, it's not easy to put it into the current structure though.</p>

<p>Another bigger one is OCR for the written words, there are open-source libraries, though not sure how mature they are, all the original writing information are saved in file, it might be easy to add this feature.</p>

<p>A small one is to replay the writing process of the note, since all the timing infomation was saved too, this is not hard to implement.</p>

<p>...</p>

<h2>Why open sourced</h2>

<p>It's sadly that I can't put more dedicated time into it, since it didn't bring much money as a product for a small group of people, though I get quite some very good comments from some users.</p>

<p>I feel very happy that some people found it useful and use it frequently, so in case any of them are programmer, I decided to put all the source codes at github, please fork it if you're interesting.</p>

<p>Might write more about the technical side of the project later, what I've learned, and how to extend it.</p>
