<div class="entry-content"><p>Since August 2012, 2 developers(including me) and 2 graphic designers come together and started a small game studio to work on some mobile casual games, as the tech lead, I need to choose a development way for our first batch of games.</p>

<p>Our games will be mostly 2D games, might with some 3D charactors, though the scenes or levels will be 2D, I think that&#8217;s better for the team and the graphic quality of the games.</p>

<p>After quite some readings and experiments, I finally have a clear idea about how we gonna build these games, We will create our small game engine, on top of Marmalade and IwGame.</p>

<h2>Why choose Marmalade?</h2>

<p>I did have quite some experience on cocos2d, though it&#8217;s been ruled out pretty quickly. I want our game to work on multiple platforms, since we don&#8217;t use much platform-specific features, we don&#8217;t get much with objective-c. Also personally I am not really a big fan of cocos2d, it&#8217;s kind of a simple framework with good quality, though missing some of the features I want with a solid framework, e.g. Tool or Markup for graphic scene editor, I&#8217;ve tried Cocos Builder and Level Helper very breifly, might be just me, but I don&#8217;t like neither one. A similar option is to go with cocos2d-x, which is cross platform, but because of similar reason, I didn&#8217;t dig into it deeply.</p>

<p>The second option is Unity3d, I&#8217;ve used it for about 3 months before, It&#8217;s pretty good, easy to use, and have a hugh community with tons of good plugins. My biggest concern about it is the binary format of the prefebs, it&#8217;s a bit like the xib file in App development, hard to change and track, as a developer, I want a text based format. Also don&#8217;t really think the .Net virtual machine is the best way for our rather small games. My feeling is that it&#8217;s more like a tool for game designers and graphic designers, as developers, we gave up full control in exchange with a full-feature game development environment. And also it&#8217;s mostly 3D centric, 2D works are possible, but a bit awkard, since we don&#8217;t need the 3D power and I want more control with my codes, I did not take this path either.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>For good performance and graphic effects, I didn&#8217;t investigate the fast development tools, most of them are HTML based or LUA based, more like quick prototype tools for me.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve played with Airplay for a couple of days 2 years ago, technically it was very good, though with a rather steep learning curve, and lack of tutorials and blog post, so I didn&#8217;t really learn it as a hobby. Now it&#8217;s renamed to Marmalade, been updated pretty often, and having a much bigger user base and many successful games are based on it, like Draw Something or Cut The Rope. Since I will use the chosen platform for at least 1 or 2 years, I spend a week to really try to learn it this time.</p>

<p>The first impression was kind of negative, the OSX support seems to be much weaker than the windows one, a bunch of small problems were met, which almost make me give it up. Now I&#8217;ve been using it for about 1 month, still got some problem, though I think I start to feel comfortable with it.</p>

<p>There are still very few technical information about marmalade other than the official documents and forum, the only helpful tutorial I can find is the <a href="http://www.drmop.com/index.php/marmalade-sdk-tutorials/">DrMop tutorials</a>. It&#8217;s very helpful to provide basic ideas for new Marmalade users.</p>

<p>The API documents of Marmalade is actually quite good after you get the basic ideas about it. Also the examples included are good learning source.</p>

<p>My current feeling about Marmalade is quite positive, it has nice features and solid quality, provide full control, has native bridge for potential platform-specific development.</p>

<p>The things I wish to be better:</p>

<ul>
<li>1st class OSX support, add the missing features of the simulator, fix the broken &#8220;mkb &#8211;iphone&#8221; device building (only trid on 10.8 + Xcode 4.4, not sure about other environments).</li>
<li>Release to osx ability, then I can create desktop tools such as customized level editor instead of let my graphic designers to use the simulator to run them.</li>
<li>Float data types in IwGx, it&#8217;s said to be included in 6.1 release which should be out soon, much simpler and less error-prone, we&#8217;ll target on OpenGL ES 2.0 devices only (iOS devices first) to make our life easier since we can&#8217;t afford dedicated tester anyway.</li>
<li>High level document besides API reference, and generally more documentations.</li>
<li>Better community and 3rd party components, it&#8217;s quite unpopular in stackoverflow, very few blogs, and the github community projects are not very active and organized.</li>
</ul>


<h2>What is IwGame, and Why it is Helpful</h2>

<p>Marmalade is very low level, its design priciple is that people can make their engine working on it rather easily, but we don&#8217;t have any game engine yet, so either I need to write a 2D engine from scratch, or choose a C/C++ engine to work with. Cocos2d-X works on Marmalade, though I want something more powerful. Many 3D engine works on it too, but they are too complex to me, I probably will choose Unity3D if I want a 3D engine.</p>

<p>According to the website, <a href="http://www.drmop.com/index.php/iwgame-engine/">IwGame</a> is a &#8220;Free Open Source Cross Platform Mobile Game Engine for Smart Phones and Tablets&#8221;, it&#8217;s a quite ambitious project, already has a long feature list with many future features, though still in an rather early stage.</p>

<p>The main reasons I chose it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open source, I can tweak the codes to suit my needs better, and even if its development stopped, we can still improve it by ourselves.</li>
<li>XML file format, it&#8217;s very powerful, e.g. make simple animations easily without coding. Also it&#8217;s very easy to extend the system to add our own extensions. This is a hugh advantage to me.</li>
<li>Complete 2D framework, including sprite, scene, particle, physics, UI&#8230; No need to reimplement the basic things from the scratch, we can focus on more interesting stuffs.</li>
<li>Support 2D and 3D rendering, since the rendering codes are based on IwGx now, even for 2D games, some part of 3D elements can be very useful, so I think this flexibility is very good.</li>
<li>Good document and a full game source included, there are quite some typos in the included PDF document, though it provide most information I need to get started, plus reading the source code, It&#8217;s kind of easy to learn (though still much harder comparing to cocos2d family).</li>
<li>Good code quality, easy to read and not hard to expand.</li>
</ul>


<p>Some worries about base our codes on it:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s a big project, and seems most code and docs are written by DrMop in several monthes. He did very great so far, though he has too many works ahead him, I am not sure where this project will be after 1 year, what if it&#8217;s dead? also it&#8217;s been a while since the last update.</li>
<li>On the other hand, if it&#8217;s been developed rapidly, since it&#8217;s not finished yet, we will need to expand it by ourself, it can be a problem to keep update with the future updates. I don&#8217;t want to make a fork since many good features are on the list, though we can&#8217;t wait for they to appear, We will be careful with out changes to make them easy to merge, but what if the owner decide to change the API interface drasticly?</li>
<li>The core string class (CIwGameString) is not unicode compatible, and the author didn&#8217;t have plan to support it soon. This can be a big problem for us to support multiple language, especially the asian languages. I want to find a clean solution for this, though haven&#8217;t started working on it yet.</li>
<li>There is no unit tests yet, so it might introduce its own bugs, especially if it&#8217;s been update quickly.</li>
</ul>


<h2>My Plan on The Game Engine</h2>

<p>Now I feel OK working with Marmalade and IwGame, the next steps will be creating the features/tools we need for our games, i.e. create a game engine for our requirements.</p>

<p>Here is the current list of works to be done:</p>

<ul>
<li>Basic level editing, to arrange 2D sprites on screen, supporting basic operations such as moving, scaling, rotating, etc. Our level/scene will be 2D non-tile with multiple layers, something similar to <a href="http://javilop.com/gamedev/c-game-programming-tutorial-non-tile-based-arbitrary-positioned-entity-engine-editor-like-in-braid-or-aquaria-games/">this</a></li>
<li>Complex charactor editing, 2D or 3D charactors with body parts, movement and animations.</li>
<li>Advanced level editing, particles, visual effects, events, etc.</li>
<li>UI editing.</li>
</ul>


<p>All these editors will base on the XOML markup system of IwGame.</p>

<p>These are still quite some works, might be over engineering for our first game, though as a developer, I don&#8217;t want to just do things in the quick and dirty way, I want to do it in a proper way. And I think a proper engine can make future games easier to develop, so in the long run, it will worth the efforts.</p>

<p>Think I will start to write more about Marmalade and IwGame in the future, both help myself to understand them better, and hopefully might help some other developers too.</p>
