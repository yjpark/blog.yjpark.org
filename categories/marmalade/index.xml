      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the days to develop our first game: &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/day-day-birds/id608802879?mt=8&amp;amp;uo=4&#34;&gt;Day Day Birds&lt;/a&gt;, I went through the progress of learning to use Marmalade, generally it&amp;rsquo;s very easy to use, and save me lot of time, though there are some little things that I hoped that I know earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;stack-size&#34;&gt;Stack Size&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game started to crash randomly before I noticed, it&amp;rsquo;s quite hard to debug, especially without the tools in Xcode or other IDEs provide. And it never crash in the simulator, so the debugging is quite awkward, a lot of guess, build, test-run going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it crashed on iOS device, some information were provided, though full stack trace is not availabe, and the place of crash is not consistent. After 2 or 3 days and nights figihting with this bug, finally found out the root cause, which is very surprising.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>The audio and music are playing a very important role in games, for our future games, I want them to have good quality of audio and music, e.g. don&amp;rsquo;t use short loop of mp3 music, but something much longer and more dynamic without taking much space. My first thought is to use MIDI+soundfonts or some mod-based music, so I spent some time to try to see the possibility.
There are quite some libraries to support xm playback, though I can&amp;rsquo;t find any Marmalade extensions on the web, in the forum someone mentioned that they made use of FMOD in their game, though there is no code shared, and FMOD is quite expansive.</description>

      <title>Convert Cocos2D Font (BMFont) to Marmalade&#39;s GxFont</title>

      <description>In 2D games, it&amp;rsquo;s typical to use image based font for UI elements, which can provide better graphic result, fast rendering, and usually smaller then true type fonts (especially if you want to support languages with big character set, e.g. Chinese).
There are quite some tools to generate such font images, I&amp;rsquo;m using bmGlyph as the font generator, it can publish the popular &amp;ldquo;Cocos2d / BMFont&amp;rdquo; format, though it&amp;rsquo;s not directly usable in Marmalade.</description>

      <title>OpenGL ES 2.0 Shader in Marmalade</title>

      <description>Marmalade provide good support for writing custom shaders in it, though it&amp;rsquo;s not easy to get all the information to start writing the first shader in my case, here is some information that I gathered during the process.
I decided to only support Open GL 2.0 Shaders in our games, most current devices support it, and as a small team, supporting older devices is a bit hard since we don&amp;rsquo;t have testers for now, also the architect of 2.</description>

      <description>Since August 2012, 2 developers(including me) and 2 graphic designers come together and started a small game studio to work on some mobile casual games, as the tech lead, I need to choose a development way for our first batch of games.
Our games will be mostly 2D games, might with some 3D charactors, though the scenes or levels will be 2D, I think that&amp;rsquo;s better for the team and the graphic quality of the games.</description>
