      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing quite some F# coding lately, which is really nice, plan to write more about F# later, here I&amp;rsquo;m gonna talk about how to build DotNet projects with Fake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve put common logic as libraries, then can share them easily across multiple projects, so I need to create NuGet packages. I&amp;rsquo;ve already created more than a dozen individual libraries, it&amp;rsquo;s clear that I need an automated process to manage them, or it&amp;rsquo;s very tedious to keep proper version of libraries in each project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve did some small work around Fake to make such process, which works quite nicely for me, I plan to write two articles on this, this one will explain the basic structure, and how I use it to manage multiple projects easily, the next one will talk about how to create NuGet package, and how to use a hacky way to do local development easily.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
